## :scroll: Project description
A solver of a simplified Mastermind-like game. Based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm.


## :hammer: Technologies used
- Python 3.7.8
- OpenAI gym 0.17.2
- Keras 2.4.3
- Keras_rl2 1.0.4
- Matplotlib 3.3.10
- Tensorflow 2.3.0


## :arrow_up: Room for improvement
This is an old project of mine and it would certainly benefit from:
- refactoring the code into better functions,
- refactoring the code into different files,
- getting rid of many anti-patterns,
- having tests written for it.
